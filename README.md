# Hi there, i'm Paulo Oliveira 👋

#### I am a person who graduated from high school at the end of 2023 and who decided to pursue my passion for programming. I'm currently in the first steps of my journey, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My goal is to become a renowned Python professional in the future. Thanks to Alura's course program, I see my dream getting closer and closer. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this fascinating field of technology!
